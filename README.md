## Introduction

METRICSTICS (a portmanteau of METRICS and STATISTICS), is a system for finding m, M, o, d, μ, MAD, and σ. The system takes a random number of data values as inputand output its descriptive statistics. The random data could be real, obtained from an authoritative source, or could be artificial, generated using a random data generator.

The purpose of the project is to create a set of interrelated artifacts for conducting certain measurements related to METRICSTICS.

In the rest of the document, ‘METRICSTICS’ stands for the name of both the project and the product, unless otherwise stated. The work on METRICSTICS has been divided into a collection of related problems. These problems have been annotated with notes, as necessary.

A system to analyse sales performance data has been developed by implementing METRICSTICS and it's required functions. This allows for the statistical analysis of sales data such that the users of the system are able to make informed decisions based on the insights gained.
